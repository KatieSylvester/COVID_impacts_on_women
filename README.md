## <a name="summary"></a>Executive Summary
As COVID-19 continues to impact lives around the word, this project looks at how the pandemic has specifically affected women.  I analyze the data in three general socio-economic areas:
- Employment – I will look an unemployment rates, the 'not in labor' population level, and the rate at which women lost jobs in each economic SuperSector. 
- Unpaid Labor – Decades of research shows that women have historically shouldered a disproportionate amount of household and caretaker work. COVID-19 certainly increased the overall household burden with childcare centers and schools closed.  I will analyze data to determine if women are continuing to bear all of the increased burden or if the labor is being more equitably distributed in households.
- Mental health – I will look at mental health statistics to analyze how COVID has impacted women from a mental health standpoint.

My career was entrenched in an industry sector that ended up being completely shut down by COVID.  Additionally, our children’s schools were closed and we had the increased burden of daily care and education while working and looking for work. I am interested to see how my story may parallel the larger economy.

## <a name="conclusions"></a>Conclusions
While no one has gone unscathed in the fallout from COVID-19, the impact on women has been disastrous. 

This is the first U.S. economic recession to cause significantly more job losses for women than men. The economic sectors that have the most representation of women have been the hardest hit with job losses (leisure and hospitality, education/health services).  In addition, women have been disproportionately more likely to lose their job than men.    

Furthermore, unpaid labor continues to be a more significant burden for women. Activities such as dependent care, elder care, and general household management all fall more on women on average. With COVID, we saw more women drop out of the labor force due to child-care issues than men.

For mental health, the data shows that women are more likely to say they have increased anxiousness due to COVID and also are more likely to report that COVID has significantly impacted their mental health negatively, suggesting that stress from the pandemic is being felt more acutely by women.
